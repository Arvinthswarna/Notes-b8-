	Class and Objects

	Functions:
	---------
		fun functionName(){
		//stmts;
		}

		functionName()


		Function with parameters
		Returning values from a function
		
		Lambda Function:
		----------------
				Function with no name.
				Defined with {} which takes variables as parameter and body of a function.
				Syntax:
				-------
					{variable -> function_body}

		AIC: Annonymous Inner Class

		Kotlin Collections:
		===================
		Overview:	
		---------
				A collection contains a number of objects of the same type.
				Objects in a collection are called elements or items.

				Example:
					All Employees in a company forms a collection.

				Collection Types:
				==================

				1) Immutable collection (or collection)
								Methods of immutable collection that supports read functionlities :


						List  listOf():
								List is an ordered collection with acess to elements by indices (integer numbers that reflect position).
								Elements can occur more than once in a list.

						Set    setOf():
								Set is a collection of unique elements . It reflects the mathematical abstraction 
								of set.(group of objects without repetations)

						Map    mapOf():(or dictionary)
								set of key-value pairs.Keys are unique and each of them maps to exactly one value.


				2) Mutable Collection:
						Mutable collections supports both read and write functionalities.
						
						List  ArrayList<T>()
						      arrayListOf()
						      mutuableListOf()


						Map   HashMap
						      hasMaoOf()
						      MutableMapOf()


						Set  hasSetOf()
						     mutableSetOf()
